title: Creating this SvelteKit markdown blog
plants: ['web development']

The time finally came where I should create my own landing page, and I had just heard about [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) from a friend.
After a bit of research, it became the clear choice in framework for the project given how lightweight and performant it claims to be.


After creating this website, I can easily say that was the correct decision. The Svelte development experience has been nothing short
of seamless and empowering. I hope that this might inspire you to give Svelte a try, or maybe even provide a guide to starting a similar project or blog.
