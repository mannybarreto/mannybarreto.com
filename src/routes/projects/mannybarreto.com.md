## Motivation

For a while now, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) has been my go-to method for any form of writing I find myself doing. Because of this, the idea of using static site generators like [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create my very tardy personal website/blog has always appealed to me. After giving each of these frameworks a try, I found myself quickly losing interest on each project very quickly. This quick disconnect likely comes from the personalization experience to be too far removed from the HTML/CSS/JavaScript for my preference.

That vacancy, coupled with my interest in exploring SvelteKit, led me to explore this solution using MDsveX to dynamically render my portfolio and blog posts from a markdown format while maintaining the Svelte development experience. I wanted to keep the website, lightweight so I decided to limit the number of dependencies but made an exception for Tailwind CSS, which I thought fit the minimal text theme.
